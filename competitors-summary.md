## Competitor Deep Dives

---

### 1. Zocdoc
**zocdoc.com** · Category: Patient acquisition marketplace

#### Positioning
*"Patient growth you can count on."*
Zocdoc is a consumer-facing scheduling marketplace where patients search for and book care. Urgent care was added as a distinct vertical in 2023. Providers pay per new patient booked — no upfront subscription for marketplace access.

#### Pricing
Pay-per-new-patient. Reported fee: $35–$110/new patient depending on specialty and region. Practice Solutions tools (reminders, website scheduling) are bundled free.

#### Strengths
- Largest consumer-facing healthcare scheduling marketplace in the US — providers get inbound demand, not just tools
- Compelling urgent care data: 80% of bookers saw an urgent care provider within 24 hours; 50%+ of bookings happen within 5 hours of the visit
- Strong same-day and after-hours demand capture (25% of urgent care bookings between 6–11PM)
- 175+ EHR integrations with real-time calendar sync
- New: Zo AI phone assistant handles inbound calls autonomously
- 84% of Zocdoc users returned to the same provider for follow-up visits

#### Weaknesses
- Purely a demand-generation tool — zero operational depth once the patient is booked
- No queue management, wait time visibility, or front-desk workflow tools
- No multi-site operator analytics or network-level performance layer
- Per-patient fee model becomes expensive at scale and provides no value on returning patients
- No recapture or waitlist management beyond basic reminders

#### Messaging Gaps (Solv's Opening)
Zocdoc fills the waiting room but doesn't help you run it. Operators who rely on Zocdoc still come to work every morning with the same fires: phones ringing, no-shows, no visibility across sites. Solv is what happens after the patient books.

### 2. Phreesia
**phreesia.com** · Category: Patient intake + RCM

#### Positioning
*"The #1 platform for intake, scheduling, payments, and engagement."*
KLAS-rated leader in patient intake management. Built for mid-to-large healthcare organizations: health systems, multispecialty groups, children's hospitals. Urgent care is not a named primary segment.

#### Pricing
Custom/quote-based. Reported range: $250–$800+/month depending on org size and modules.

#### Strengths
- Dominant brand in patient intake — widely considered the category leader
- Strong compliance and financial workflow depth: insurance verification, payment collection, referral management
- Unique dual revenue model: Phreesia Network (pharma/life sciences point-of-care media) subsidizes platform development
- Proven at enterprise scale with Epic, athenahealth, and major EHR integrations
- 150M+ patient visits annually across its network

#### Weaknesses
- Not built for urgent care or walk-in workflows — no queue management, wait time tools, or walk-in conversion features
- Heavy implementation designed for scheduled-appointment environments, not high-velocity same-day settings
- No demand-generation component — purely a back-end platform
- Enterprise pricing and sales process is likely inaccessible for independent urgent care operators
- No AI scheduling or conversational AI in core positioning

#### Messaging Gaps (Solv's Opening)
Phreesia was built for scheduled medicine. Urgent care runs on walk-ins, same-day surges, and 3-hour booking windows. Solv is built for how urgent care actually works — not adapted from a primary care platform.

---

### 3. NexHealth
**nexhealth.com** · Category: Front-office automation

#### Positioning
*"Automate Your Front-Office"*
*"Your patient is ready — Scheduling, intake, and payments that sync to the patient record. Every appointment. Zero reconciliation."*
Differentiated by its proprietary Synchronizer technology that enables real-time bidirectional EHR sync across 60+ health record systems.

#### Pricing
Starts at $350/month. Three tiers (Starter, Standard, Pro). No setup fees, no long-term contracts required.

#### Strengths
- Technical differentiation on EHR sync — true bidirectional sync vs. competitors that require manual reconciliation
- Clean product with strong UX reputation; fast U.S.-based support (sub-2 minute response time)
- Broad feature set at a competitive price point: scheduling, intake, payments, messaging, reviews
- No long-term contracts reduces switching risk for evaluators
- Strong in dental (25,000+ providers) with a growing medical segment

#### Weaknesses
- Heavily indexed toward dental — urgent care and on-demand workflows are absent from core positioning
- No queue management, wait time visibility, or walk-in features
- No demand-generation marketplace
- Limited multi-site operator tools — no network-level analytics or group management layer
- No AI scheduling agent or conversational automation in core offering
- $350/month starting price with no urgent care-specific value proposition

#### Messaging Gaps (Solv's Opening)
NexHealth automated the dental front desk. Urgent care is a different animal — walk-in surges, 90-minute visit cycles, and 5-location operators who need to see Site 3's wait time without making a phone call. NexHealth doesn't know that world. Solv was built inside it.

---

### 4. Luma Health
**lumahealth.io** · Category: Operational AI platform

#### Positioning
*"Operational AI for Healthcare"*
*"Needing care is hard. Getting it should be easy."*
Luma positions itself as an agentic AI platform that "orchestrates" patient journeys across access, engagement, intake, and payments. Built for enterprise health systems and large regional networks with complex, multi-department workflows.

#### Pricing
Custom/quote-based only. Expensive — flagged in reviews as inaccessible for smaller practices.

#### Strengths
- Most sophisticated AI narrative in the competitive set — "agentic" framing with a purpose-built AI engine (Spark) is differentiated positioning
- Deep EHR integration library (70+) with bidirectional sync across Epic, Oracle Health, MEDITECH, athenahealth
- Strong outcomes data: 2.5M staff hours saved in 2025, 61-day reduction in time to care
- Covers full patient journey in one platform (access through payment)
- Fax automation is a unique differentiator for specialist referral workflows in complex health systems

#### Weaknesses
- Positioned almost entirely at enterprise health systems — complex implementations exclude most independent urgent care operators
- No patient acquisition or demand-generation component
- Despite "urgent care wait time visibility" appearing in their intake feature list, urgent care is not a named segment — feels secondary
- Enterprise pricing and implementation complexity creates a high barrier for multi-site urgent care chains
- "Agentic AI" and "orchestration" language is technically compelling but may obscure product clarity for ops-minded buyers evaluating multiple vendors

#### Messaging Gaps (Solv's Opening)
Luma is building AI infrastructure for health systems with dedicated IT departments. The VP of Ops running 12 urgent care sites doesn't have a system architect. They need something that's live in a day and shows ROI in 30. Solv is that. Luma is not.

---

### 5. Experity
**experityhealth.com** · Category: Urgent care EMR + patient engagement

#### Positioning
*"The #1 Urgent Care Software & EMR"*
*"The digital front door to healthcare"*
Formed from the merger of Practice Velocity and DocuTAP (2019). The only competitor in this set purpose-built exclusively for urgent care. Owns both the clinical (EMR) and patient experience (scheduling, check-in, engagement) stack.

#### Pricing
Custom/quote-based. Reported starting price ~$2.20/month/user (likely base tier only).

#### Strengths
- Only direct urgent care-native competitor — deepest domain specificity by far
- End-to-end platform: EMR + PM + billing + patient engagement in a single system
- Queue and wait time visibility are genuine urgent care-specific features
- Care Agent (launched July 2025) — AI-powered post-visit engagement via SMS/RCS with white-label branding
- White-label patient experience is a specific counter-positioning to marketplace tools like Solv and Zocdoc
- Specific and compelling claim: *"5.7 additional visits per day"* with Experity's engagement solutions
- Register patients in under 2 minutes; chart 90% of common visits in under 60 seconds

#### Weaknesses
- EMR-centric identity makes it feel like infrastructure investment, not a growth platform — a different buying motion
- Care Agent is new (launched July 2025) and unproven at scale relative to Solv's established track record
- No demand-generation or marketplace component — operators must drive their own patient acquisition
- Pricing opacity makes evaluation difficult for buyers comparing total cost
- User satisfaction scores (82% per EMRFinder) lower than some competitors, with reviews citing product complexity
- White-label argument only works if operators already distrust third-party patient-facing tools — a somewhat defensive framing

#### Messaging Gaps (Solv's Opening)
Experity is the operating system for the exam room. Solv is the operating system for the business. Operators who already have an EMR (many use Experity) still need a patient acquisition and flow management layer that Experity doesn't provide. Solv wraps around any EMR — including Experity.

---

## Messaging Whitespace: Where Solv Wins

### What none of them own:
- **Multi-site operator visibility** — the ability for a VP of Ops to see real-time performance across all locations from one dashboard. This is table stakes for Marcus but missing from every competitor's primary positioning.
- **The acquisition-to-operations bridge** — Zocdoc fills the calendar. Phreesia, NexHealth, and Luma manage what happens next. Solv is the only platform that explicitly does both — drives new patients *and* helps you run the operation once they arrive.
- **Built for the operator, not the IT department** — Luma and Phreesia require implementation projects. NexHealth and Experity require integration setup. Solv's sub-one-day rollout and zero-IT-requirement is a genuine differentiator that none of them claim.
- **Urgent care-specific without EMR lock-in** — Experity is urgent care-native but only fully delivers if you're on their EMR. Solv is urgent care-native and EHR-agnostic.

### Phrases worth owning in Solv's messaging:
- *"The only platform built for multi-site urgent care operators"* (Experity is close, but EMR-first)
- *"Works alongside your EMR — not instead of it"* (directly undercuts Experity's switching cost argument)
- *"From the first Google search to the five-star review"* (full patient journey framing no competitor occupies)
- *"Live in a day. ROI in 30."* (directly counters the implementation complexity objection raised by Luma and Phreesia)

## Competitive Landmines to Avoid

| Risk | What to watch |
|---|---|
| Zocdoc expands into operations | Zo AI + upcoming features could push them post-booking |
| Luma Health moves down-market | Their agentic AI narrative is compelling if they simplify pricing |
| Experity doubles down on Care Agent | The only competitor who truly understands urgent care ops |
| NexHealth adds urgent care vertical | Low switching cost + strong UX = a credible threat if they prioritize it |
