# Buyer Persona: The Multi-Site Urgent Care Operator

## Who They Are

**Name:** Marcus
**Title:** VP of Operations / Regional Director
**Company:** Multi-location urgent care group (5–25 sites)
**Age:** 38–52
**Reports to:** CEO or CFO

---

## Background

Marcus has been in healthcare operations for 10+ years. He may have started as a clinic manager and worked his way up, or came from a hospital/health system background. He owns the day-to-day performance of every site — staffing, patient volume, wait times, revenue, and satisfaction scores. He's not a doctor, but he speaks both clinical and business fluently.

He's always managing up (board/investors want growth) and down (site managers want support). He's stretched thin.

## Goals

- **Fill schedules and grow visit volume** without increasing headcount
- **Reduce operational chaos** — especially around front desk bottlenecks and lobby overcrowding
- **Standardize workflows** across all locations so quality doesn't depend on which site a patient visits
- **Improve patient satisfaction scores** (Google reviews, NPS) to stay competitive
- **Give his site managers better tools** so they stop calling him with the same problems

---

## Pain Points

- **Phone volume is out of control.** Front desk staff spend half their shift on hold or playing phone tag with patients. It burns out good people.
- **No-shows kill revenue.** A patient who doesn't show is a slot that could've gone to someone else. Reminders are inconsistent.
- **He can't see what's happening across sites in real time.** He's flying blind until end-of-day reports, and by then it's too late to fix anything.
- **Each location does things slightly differently.** New staff learn bad habits from whoever trained them. There's no single source of truth.
- **Patients leave for competitors when wait times feel unpredictable.** If they can't see a wait time online, they assume the worst and book elsewhere.

## A Day in His Life

7:30am — Checks overnight messages. One site is short-staffed. Another had a surge at close and the wait backed up.

9:00am — Back-to-back calls with site managers. Half the issues are about patient complaints or staffing gaps.

12:00pm — Reviews prior day visit volume by location. Tries to figure out why Site 3 is underperforming again.

2:00pm — Meeting with CFO. Needs to justify headcount or explain why revenue is below forecast.

5:00pm — Responds to a negative Google review left by a patient who waited 90 minutes without an update.

He rarely has a quiet hour to evaluate new software. He needs to see ROI fast and trust that rollout won't create more problems than it solves.

## What He Needs to Hear

- "Your front desk staff will handle fewer interruptions."
- "You'll see what's happening at every site without asking."
- "Patients who book online show up more and complain less."
- "We've done this rollout dozens of times. Here's what it looks like."

## What Turns Him Off

- Long implementation timelines
- Tools that require heavy IT involvement
- Vendors who lead with features instead of outcomes
- Anything that adds steps for already-overwhelmed front desk staff

---

## Buying Behavior

- **Research:** Leans on peer recommendations from other operators. Checks G2, Capterra, and LinkedIn. May have seen Solv at a UCAOA conference.
- **Decision process:** Involves his site managers in the evaluation. Needs buy-in from the front desk before he'll commit.
- **Timeline:** Moves fast once he's convinced — he has problems to solve now.
- **Budget authority:** Usually has discretion up to $50K/year. Larger contracts go to CFO/CEO.
- **Key objection:** "Will my staff actually use it?"

## The Outcome He's Buying

Marcus isn't buying software. He's buying back his time, fewer fires to put out, and the ability to tell his board that operations are tightening while patient experience is improving.
